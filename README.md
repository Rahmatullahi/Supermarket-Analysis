## Introduction

This is a supermarket outlet project where I leveraged data science to make an informed strategic decision.  In particular, I am keen to use data to find high-performing products in their portfolio offering to maximize profits and customer satisfaction.

## Data sourcing
The supermarket has maintained its customer data on a simple Excel spreadsheet with 1001 columns and 21 rows.

## Problem Statement

1. What is the distribution of Male to Female customers? 
2. What is the age distribution of customers?
3. How many customers are considered Members (i.e., they use a Loyalty card while shopping) versus Normal customers 
4. What is the most common method of payment to the supermarket?  And Which type of customers use this method the most 
5. Which product generates the most sales in the supermarket? 
6. Which branch generates the most sales? Which type of customers tend to use this branch the most
7. Which city generates the most sales? Which type of customer contributes the most in this city

## Conclusion and Recommendation

Based on the analysis, I recommend that the supermarket should use the following strategy

1. Product Offerings: The supermarket can focus on selling the products in the Food and beverages category since that is what generates the most sales and have the highest
gross income.
2. Customer Retention: The supermarket can focus on retaining more of its customers as members since that proves to have the higher percentage in all the cities and all the branches.
3. Branch Promotions: The supermarket can target its promotions to Branch C since it is the branch that generates the most sales.
